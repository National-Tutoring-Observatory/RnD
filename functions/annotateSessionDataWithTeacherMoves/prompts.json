Your task is to read a conversation snippet of a tutoring session between a student and tutor, and determine what type of error the student makes in the conversation. We have a list of common errors that students make in math, which you can pick from. We also give you the option to write in your own error type if none of the options apply.\n\nError list:\n0. Student does not seem to understand or guessed the answer.\n1. Student misinterpreted the question.\n2. Student made a careless mistake.\n3. Student has the right idea, but is not quite there.\n4. Student's answer is not precise enough or the tutor is being too picky about the form of the student's answer.\n5. None of the above, but I have a different description (please specify in your reasoning).\n6. Not sure, but I'm going to try to diagnose the student.\n\nHere is the conversation snippet:\n\nWhy do you think the student made this mistake?

Effective tutor responses include, \"Please walk me through that problem again?\" and \"Can you explain to me what you did here?\" Ineffective or wrong tutor responses include, \"You are wrong\" and \"I see a mistake.",
